# apollographql

#### :point_right: First clone the graphql in your plugin folder from https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql

#### :point_right: After activate the plugin, visit http://localhost/wordpress/?graphql

#### :point_right: If it show a page of error, then confirmed wp-graphql plugin works.

#### :point_right: Let's create a brand new react app by the command;
`npx create-react-app apollographql`
> Note: npx is a npm package runner. The typical use is to download and run a package temporarily or for trials.

#### :point_right: Go to project folder and start this app
`cd apollographql && npm start`

#### :point_right: We need to install three packages to use graphQL in React. Apollo makes possible to write a query in graphQL.
1. https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-boost
2. https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-apollo
3. https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql

**Also we need more cuple of think,**
+ https://milligram.io/ for quick style
+ https://www.styled-components.com/ styling components
+ https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start for pagination system
+ https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify for safe DOM rander in React app

#### :point_right: Install these packages with the command -
`npm i apollo-boost react-apollo graphql react-router-dom milligram styled-components dompurify`
> Note: By default, these packages install for development only. Here, `i` is the shorthand for `install` command. 

#### :point_right: We will create some components. These are:
- [ ] AppRouter
- [ ] App
- [ ] Posts
- [ ] PostWidget
- [ ] Post
- [ ] NotFound

#### :point_right: First, create a file in `/src` named `AppRouter.js`. Be sure about the naming convention. React follow camel casing for both filename and class name.
**Open `src/AppRouter.js`. We know, for every react component we have to import React from react package. For the first sight, we will define AppRouter in this file.**

```JS
import React from "react";
class AppRouter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Router</div>;
  }
}
export default AppRouter;
```

#### :point_right: Open src/index.js, it application start. Remove index.css in App importer. At last, use AppRouter in ReactDom. So the fiinal code at src/inde.js like,
```JS
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import AppRouter from "./AppRouter";
import * as serviceWorker from "./serviceWorker";
ReactDOM.render(<AppRouter />, document.getElementById("root"));
// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
```

#### :point_right: AppRouter component is defined as App, Post, and NotFound.
**The app is mixed up with Posts and PostWidget.**
**Posts and a PostWidget components will use in the App component**
#### :point_right: Post component for a single post and NotFound component for the wrong URL enter our application. 
#### :point_right: For this Application, we will take advantage of ES6 and JSX. 
#### :point_right:  Besides these packages, we will also use five custom components.
#### :point_right:  Delete src/App.js. Create a folder component. 
#### :point_right: In this folder, create App.js, Posts.js, PostWidget.js, Post.js, NotFound.js. 
#### :point_right: Here, just declare a component class for now.

#### :point_right: Open src/components/App.js and write the following code.

```JS
import React from "react";
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>App</div>;
  }
}
export default App;
```
